Pengetua kolej, Chris Wilkes, berkata keputusan itu berkaitan dengan \"bilangan pelajar yang rendah dan bukannya sebab lain\". Beliau berkata kolej akan terus memberi tumpuan kepada pendidikan dewasa. Alumni terkenal Kolej Ruskin termasuk bekas timbalan perdana menteri John Prescott dan Dennis Skinner, MP untuk Bolsover di Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences dan MA Women\\'s Studies sedang dihentikan. Anne Hughes, 63, dari Thame di Oxfordshire, telah belajar BA English Studies secara separuh masa di kolej selama dua tahun. Beliau berkata beliau \"sangat kecewa\" ia dihentikan. Beliau mempunyai kecacatan fizikal dan mengalami kemurungan, dan berkata beliau memilih untuk belajar di kolej kerana ia bekerja dengan \"pelajar yang kurang bernasib baik, cacat dan dewasa\". Kolej juga menawarkan jadual waktu yang disesuaikan, tidak seperti beberapa tempat pendidikan tinggi lain, tambahnya. Petisyen dalam talian telah ditubuhkan dalam usaha untuk menyelamatkan fakulti Bahasa Inggeris dan kursus Women\\'s Studies. Seorang penandatangan, Jenny Lewis, menulis pada petisyen pertama: \"[Tukang ajar] Helen Kidd dan Tom Sherry meneruskan tradisi hebat Ruskin untuk membawa peluang kepada mereka yang sebaliknya tidak akan mendapatnya.\" Pelajar dan aktivis Saskia Ritchie, yang menubuhkan petisyen kedua, berkata Ruskin telah ditubuhkan untuk \"orang yang biasanya akan dikecualikan daripada akademik\" dan memberikan \"akses kepada peluang pembelajaran yang benar-benar cemerlang\". Encik Wilkes berkata kolej akan kehilangan kira-kira 25 pelajar akibat pemotongan tersebut. Beliau menambah ijazah telah ditawarkan di kolej selama kira-kira 10 tahun dan adalah \"relatif baru\" memandangkan sejarah 116 tahun kolej tersebut. \"Tumpuan kami akan terus kepada pendidikan dewasa dan saya rasa apa yang kami lakukan adalah hanya memperbaharui tawaran kami tetapi melakukannya dengan cara yang berbeza, memenuhi misi kami dengan cara yang berbeza, mungkin bagaimana kami telah melakukannya di masa lalu,\" tambah Encik Wilkes.
